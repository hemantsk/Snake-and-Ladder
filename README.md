About the game:

In this traditional game, it is assumed when a player starts to play the game, he is being pushed to a room containing snakes. He needs to exit the room as soon as possible. Here comes the play. The exit is in other end of the room and in-order to reach the door; he needs to cross each block from the place he stand.

He is having a die in his hand and rolling the die to check the number of block he can cross in each turn. If he encounters a snake in the block he will be swallowed by the snake and move back to the tail end of the snake and again he need to climb up the blocks. If he sees a ladder then he can make use of it. Thus we can see when two player competes who escape sooner from the dangerous room.


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME SNAKE AND LADDER?


Rolling a die is pressing the button. Either player 1 or 2 can start first to roll the die. The player who comes up with the value 1 on the die is allowed to enter the snake and ladder board on position 1. Player 1 is given a symbol X and player 2 is given a symbol Y. Alternative chances are given to each player throughout the game. You can check the description under player 1’s button for checking who’s turn it is. 

When X or Y (player 1 or 2) move to a position that has a ladder, then the player move to a higher block by the ladder. (Here it assumes the person climbs to a higher floor using a ladder). Whereas, when X or Y move to a position/block containing snake’s head, then they are pushed to a lower value till the tail block of that snake. (In this traditional game, it is assumed that snake bites a person and swallows them, hence the person is pushed to the tail block of the snake)
